# Minimum Viable Segment

TODO: Work this out and document it really well.


Do a survey. Email tracking maybe resend????

Who is are the users we are targeting and why should they share???

What is Mattrax's desperate customers???


https://youtu.be/QRZ_l7cVzzU?si=XeSne9SlHrhgo77U&t=636 I've been thinking a lot about this section and it concerns me we don't necessarily have it.

The more startup content I watch and the more I try and apply it to Mattrax, I feel like my mental understanding of what is good in the "early stage" of a company is getting more and more blurred.

The advice "Launch and MVP and learn for your users" is smart and very logical but I also don't yet know how it's going to work well for Mattrax.

I think "viable" being the key word. I think my vision is targeting the product at IT teams as opposed to small businesses.

As a small buisness, I probally don't wanna bet on Mattrax when it's 

Another piece of advice "launch when your product is better than the competitors" is kinda problematic in Mattrax's case. I think we are building something that is different than our competitors but we are also not inventing a new market. If I had the choice of Mattrax or a competitor, I would probably choose the competitor for quite some time just due to the lack of features. Working out how to get over that hurdle is really gonna be the linchpin in Mattrax's success.
