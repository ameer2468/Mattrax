// CmdRef MUST refer to the CmdID (section 2.2.3.2) of the SyncML command referred
// to by Status. CmdRef MUST be present in the SyncML message, except when the Status command
// refers to the SyncHdr (section 2.2.4.2) of the associated SyncML request message. For example, a
// status can be sent back to the originator for exceptions (that is, (401) Unauthorized) found within the
// SyncHdr of the originatorâ€™s request.

// The order of Status elements in a SyncML response MUST match the order of the corresponding commands in the SyncML request.
// there is a 1:1 correspondence between a command and the Status element

// When multiple Item (section 2.2.5.2) elements are specified in a command, if the status codes for
// all Items are not identical, a unique Status element MUST be returned for each Item. If all status
// codes are identical, the same Status element MAY be returned for all Items.

// MDM permits a Status to be issued against another Status (or, Status on a Status). While this
// case is not usually encountered, there are extreme cases where this feature is necessary. For
// example, if a server returns a (401) Unauthorized status code with a request for an authentication
// scheme that is not supported by the client, the client might use a (406) Optional feature
// unsupported code to notify the server that that requested authentication scheme is not supported
// and negotiate an authentication scheme that it does support. SyncML servers and SyncML clients
// that do not support this use case are not required to provide further response to the SyncML
// entity that is issuing the Status on a Status.
